                    </ul>

                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p>Renting with us is quick and easy:</p>

                    <h2>Sustainability Commitment</h2>
                    <p>
                         We believe that fashion should not come at the cost of the environment. Renting instead
                         of buying reduces waste, saves resources, and minimizes the environmental footprint of fashion.
